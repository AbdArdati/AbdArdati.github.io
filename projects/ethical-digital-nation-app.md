## Project Description

The Ethical Digital Nation Collaborative Web App was designed to bridge the gap between academic engagement and Scotland’s Ethical Digital Nation initiative. By leveraging research and education, this platform empowers universities to actively contribute to ethical digitalisation efforts. The project integrates robust **software engineering principles** and **Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)** practices, focusing on participatory and human-centric design to ensure the web application meets the needs of its stakeholders.

**Key Features:**
- A collaborative hub for knowledge sharing and events management.
- Tools to facilitate ethical digital practices in universities.
- Focus on accessibility, usability, and user engagement.

The platform supports academic collaboration on digital ethics, providing universities with the tools to participate in [Scotland’s vision for an Ethical Digital Nation](https://www.gov.scot/publications/building-trust-digital-era-achieving-scotlands-aspirations-ethical-digital-nation/documents/).

## Development Approach

An **agile development process** was employed to ensure the web application evolved through continuous user feedback. Stakeholders from Scottish universities played a pivotal role in shaping the application through a **participatory design approach**. This iterative process allowed the team to remain responsive to user needs and requirements, ensuring the application stayed aligned with the ethical goals of the project.

### Participatory Design Process:
- Involved key stakeholders from Scottish universities.
- Emphasised **human-centric design** to ensure the application was accessible and user-friendly.
- Conducted usability testing throughout the development lifecycle.

## Outcomes and Impact

The **Ethical Digital Nation Collaborative Web App** serves as a central platform for Scottish universities to engage with ethical digitalisation topics. Its **collaborative tools** foster academic cooperation, knowledge sharing, and event organisation around digital ethics.

This project contributes to the discourse on **digital ethics** in academia and provides a tangible tool to help universities align their digital practices with the Scottish Government’s Ethical Digital Nation vision.
