## Project Description

**A Web-Based Visualisation Tool for Digital Exclusion in the UK** was designed to address the pressing issue of digital exclusion revealed in the [Communications and Digital Committee report](https://lordslibrary.parliament.uk/digital-exclusion-in-the-uk-communications-and-digital-committee-report/). This project aims to develop an innovative web-based tool to help users navigate and understand [data related to digital exclusion and equality in the UK](https://www.ons.gov.uk/businessindustryandtrade/itandinternetindustry/datasets/digitalexclusionandequalityintheuk).

**Key Features:**
- **Interactive Visualisations:** Includes a choropleth map and demographic charts to explore regional disparities in digital exclusion.
- **User-Centered Design:** Developed using iterative feedback from stakeholders and potential users.
- **Intuitive Navigation:** Designed to facilitate easy exploration of complex data and patterns.

The tool is intended to provide insights into digital literacy gaps and support initiatives aimed at reducing digital exclusion across various UK communities.

## Development Approach

The development of the **Web-Based Visualisation Tool** employed a **User-Centered Design (UCD)** and **Participatory Design (PD) approach**. This iterative process involved continuous stakeholder engagement and feedback to ensure the tool effectively addressed the needs of its users.

**Development Methodology:**
- **Choropleth Map:** For visualising regional data on digital exclusion.
- **Demographic Visualisations:** To highlight thoes affected the most by digital exclusion.
- **Usability Testing:** Conducted to refine the interface and improve user experience.
- **Heuristic Evaluation:** Applied to ensure the tool's effectiveness and user-friendliness.

### Co-Design Process:
- Collaborated with stakeholders, including local councils like Fife Council.
- Integrated feedback to align the tool with user needs and awareness goals.
- Conducted iterative testing to enhance functionality and usability.

## Outcomes and Impact
- A **web-based visualisation tool** featuring interactive **choropleth maps** and **demographic visualizations**.
