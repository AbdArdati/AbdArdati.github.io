## Project Description

**WikiSync: A New Wikipedia Onboarding Tool** addresses the challenge of improving the onboarding process for new Wikipedia editors, which is crucial for enhancing editor retention. This project collaborated with Wikimedia UK to design an online tool that supports remote training efforts for Wikipedia trainers.

**Key Features:**
- **Online Onboarding Tool:** Designed to facilitate remote training and improve editor retention.
- **Participatory Design:** Involved the Wikipedia community in the design process for user-centric development.
- **Iterative Feedback:** Used user testing and feedback to refine the design and address usability issues.

The tool aims to provide an effective onboarding experience for new Wikipedia editors, blending agile development practices with the principles of participatory design.

## Development Approach

The **WikiSync** project extended previous research [1](https://research-repository.st-andrews.ac.uk/handle/10023/28494) to develop a proof of concept for the new onboarding tool. The project utilised the **Ethnographically-informed Distributed Participatory Design (EDPD) framework** to guide the design and evaluation phases.

**Development Methodology:**
- **User Testing:** Conducted with the Wikipedia community to gather feedback and identify usability issues.
- **Iterative Design Improvements:** Based on user feedback to enhance the tool's functionality and alignment with community needs.
- **Technical Feasibility:** Explored to ensure the tool’s integration with Wikipedia’s infrastructure and community culture.

### Co-Design Process:
- **Community Involvement:** Engaged Wikipedia users in evaluating and shaping the tool’s design.
- **Feedback Integration:** Iteratively refined the design based on real-world user input.
- **Agile Practices:** Applied agile methods to adapt the development process to user needs and project goals.

## Outcomes and Impact

The **WikiSync** project successfully developed a tool to improve the Wikipedia onboarding process, focusing on enhancing remote training and editor retention. Key contributions include:
- **Optimised Onboarding Experience:** Improved the support and training for new Wikipedia editors.
- **User-Centric Design:** Addressed usability challenges through iterative design and user feedback.
- **Framework Application:** Demonstrated the application of the EDPD framework in participatory design projects.
