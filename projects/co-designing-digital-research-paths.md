## Project Description

**Co-Designing Digital Research Paths for Open Knowledge Projects** is an initiative aimed at tackling the decline in academic participation within open knowledge platforms. These platforms are essential repositories of collective knowledge, but they face challenges due to diminishing contributions and questions about their academic credibility.

This project seeks to address these issues by increasing the involvement of academic researchers in open knowledge projects. It does so through the development of the **Ideator**, a digital research portal designed to help academics navigate the vast array of information available on open knowledge platforms. The tool provides researchers with a structured path for engaging in open knowledge projects, reducing confusion and improving accessibility.

**Key Features:**
- **Research Guidance Portal:** The Ideator helps guide researchers through open knowledge projects, offering a clear structure to access relevant information.
- **Participatory Design Approach:** The project uses participatory design principles to ensure the tool meets the specific needs of academic users.
- **Collaborative Development:** Involves collaboration with the IDEA Network to align the tool with broader digital research initiatives.

The **Ideator** not only supports researchers involved in open knowledge platforms but also holds the potential to extend its utility to digital research in general.

## Development Approach

The project employs a **participatory design (PD)** approach, ensuring that the development of the **Ideator** is guided by the needs and insights of its target users. Despite the constraints of a limited timeframe, PD methodologies were adapted to deliver a practical and functional prototype.

### Participatory Design Process:
- **User Engagement:** Conducted semi-structured interviews with academic researchers to gather insights on their needs and challenges when working with open knowledge platforms.
- **Thematic Analysis:** Employed thematic analysis to process interview data and identify key design requirements.
- **Iterative Design:** Feedback from user engagement sessions was used to iteratively improve the design of the Ideator tool.

**Development Methodology:**
- **Condensed PD Approach:** The project implemented a streamlined version of PD to fit the projectâ€™s timeframe, ensuring efficiency without sacrificing user-centricity.
- **Functional Prototype:** Delivered a prototype of the Ideator that addresses usability, functionality, and academic credibility concerns within open knowledge platforms.

## Outcomes and Impact

The **Co-Designing Digital Research Paths** project has resulted in:
- **Ideator Prototype:** A functional web tool designed to guide academic researchers through open knowledge projects.
- **Broader Digital Research Utility:** Potential for the Ideator to be expanded for use in a wide range of digital research activities.
- **User-Centric Design Approach:** Demonstrated the effectiveness of participatory design in creating tools that meet the specific needs of academic users.

The project contributes to increasing academic participation in open knowledge platforms by providing a structured and accessible tool for researchers, fostering collaboration, and promoting academic credibility.
