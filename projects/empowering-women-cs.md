## Description
Despite the attractive opportunities in the computer science industry, women represent a mere 5.17% of the coding community (Stack Overflow, 2022). This project aims to address gender disparity in Computer Science by developing an interactive web-based learning tool that provides inspiration and education to young women.

### Key Features:
1. **Timeline of Women's Achievements in Computer Science**: A historical overview of pioneering women in the field.
2. **Women and Computing Education**: An exploration of women's status in computer science education.
3. **Women and the Computing Workforce**: Visualisation of gender disparity in the computing industry.
4. **Contemporary Leadership Gallery**: Showcases modern female leaders in computer science, encouraging young women to pursue careers in the field.

## Objectives
- **Development of an Interactive Profile Gallery**: Showcase approximately 10 historical female role models in computing.
- **Visualising Gender Disparity in Education**: Create an interactive tool to highlight challenges women face in computer science education.
- **Visualising Gender Disparity in the Workforce**: Illustrate gender composition and underrepresentation of women in the computing industry.
- **Contemporary Leadership Gallery**: Highlight current female leaders in the tech industry.

## Artifact
The core artifact of this project is a fully developed interactive web-based tool that includes:
- **Interactive Profile Galleries**: Using The Wikidata Query Service (WDQS), highlighting both historical and contemporary women in computer science.
- **Data Visualisations**: Interactive representations of gender disparity in both education and the workforce.
- **Responsive Web Design**: The tool is optimised for various screen sizes, ensuring accessibility across multiple devices.
- **User Engagement Features**: Interactive elements aimed at engaging users, particularly young women, and inspiring them to pursue careers in computing.
